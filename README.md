# networkPilot
Welcome to the GitHub Repository for networkPilot.

As with all of my projects, at least for now, networkPilot is open-source and free for you to look at to gain knowledge with the P3D SimConnect library aswell as passing data to VATSIM.

Please enjoy to look around here and please report bugs if found.

Happy landings!
